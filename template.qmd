## Correlation vs causation

- In clinical research, it is crucial to remember that correlation is not equivalent to causation.
- Association between two variables does not necessarily imply a cause-and-effect relationship.
- Women taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) where link to a lower risk of coronary heart disease:
  - Women taking HRT tend to have a higher socioeconomic status and healthier lifestyle habits

## Level of evidence

![Source: https://openmd.com](images_presentation/levels-of-evidence.svg)

::: {.notes}
We've been taught that RCT are the study design that can prove causality and observational studies can help us to understand how for example treatments may work in clinical care (effectiveness). And we should use observational studies as hypothesis generated.

But what happens when is not feasible to conduct an RCT because of ethical issues or because the are time consuming. Additionally, we have access to routine data that we could use for answering some question. Then for example, during the pandemic many studies observational studies help clinicians to treat patients, some of them were some of them were baised though.

## Causal Effect Estimation

<br>

`Causal effect` are of interest in many field

-  Prove ***causation*** over merely ***correlation***

Causal effect describes the `effect` of an exposure on an outcome

-  New treatment 
-  Prevention program
-  New policy

::: {.notes}
Here interesting in knowning how would a outcome of patient change. I are not interested in just knowing if there is a significant correlation/assicauton between the treatment and the outcome. We really wanna know if there is a causal effect.

Potential outcome framework

- Two potential outcome for each study paticiapnt:

Outcome after receiving treatment = Y1
Outcome after receiving comparsion condition = Y0 (can be another treatmen or not treatment control)

- Y1 and Y0 exist for all individual in the population regardsles of whether the individual received treatment (Z=1) or comparison condition (Z = 0)
- Observe obly on of these outcomes for each participant
- Then the causal effect will be Y1-Y0 for a given individual

**Gold standard for estimating causal effects:**

- Randomization (if it works) makes groups being compared balance on baseline characteristics. (observed and unobserved)
- Treatment assignment is unrelated to potential outcomes (ignorability assumption)

## Popularity of PS

![](images_presentation/popularity.png)


## Propensity scores

Propensity scores help us deal with the challenge of selection.

- The propensity score is an individualâ€™s probability of receiving the treatment given pretreatment characteristics^[Narita, K., et al. The Leadership Quarterly 2023, 101678.]

$$e_{i} = Pr(Z_{i}=1 | X_{i})$$

- Used to create balance between treatment and comparison conditons. 
- Conditional on $e_{i}$, the distribution of $X$ (measured covariates) is similar between treated and untreated (comparison) individuals.

::: {.notes}
Omiting the strong ignorability assumption, the propensity score is the probability of receiving the treatment given the observed covariates.
:::



## PS comes with assumption

Strongly ignorable assumption, two conditions^[Austin PC. et al. Multivariate Behav Res. 2011 May;46(3):399-424]

1. No unmeasured confounders: All variables affecting treatment assignment and outcome have been measured
2. Everyone has a nonzero probability to receive the treatment

## PS comes with assumption

- First assumption is not testable (using the data)
- Second assumption can be indirectly assessed by PS:

. . . 

![](plot/noWeights_notitle.svg){.absolute top=250 left=180 width=680px}




::: {.notes}

Primary types of causal effect

- ATE

Answers the question:

   - how effective is the treatment in the population? If you have a control 
   - What is the relative effectiveness of two treatments  on average in the population? (If you hace 2 treatments)
   - E(Y1 - Y0)


- ATT

Answer the question

- How effective is a particular treatment for a particular population (the target group)
- How would those who received treatment have done had they received the comparison condition? ***
- E(Y1 - Y0 | Z =1)
::: 
  

  
## Application of PS

PS can be used in different ways to estimate the treatment effect^[Thoemmes, FJ. et al.Â Multivariate Behavioral Research 2011,Â 46(1), 90-118.]

- Stratification
- Matching
- Weighting
- Regression adjustment
  

## Stratification

![](plot/stra_plot2.svg)


::: {.notes}
take each strata to estimate treatment effect. Here groups are well balanced. People with similar PS to get the treatment. After getting the ATE at each strata, they are aggregated to get a final ATE
:::

[PS application: HIV treatment]{style="position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 500px; font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;color: white"}


## HIV treatment

- Single-tablet regimens (STR) are associated with higher adherence rates, decreased hospitalizations, and a higher proportion of patients achieving undetectable viral loads compared to multi-tablet regimens (MTR)^[Sutton SS, et al. Am J Manag Care. 2016;22(4):242-8]

- STRs can lead to improved therapy satisfaction, better symptom control, enhanced health status, reduced healthcare resource utilization, and cost-effectiveness compared to MTRs^[Clay PG, et al. AIDS Res Ther 2018; 15:17]



::: {.notes}
The idea is to know if treatment A is more effective than treatment B.
We have to acknowledge people who is receiving treatment A is different from people who is receiving treatment B. And we need to deal with that in order to estimate the causal effect of the treatment.

Then not bear in mind that the analysis of longitunal data benefit from these analysis

## Variable selection for PS

Variable selection based on subject matter knowledge and considering 
 the following criteria:^[Brookhart MA, et al. Am J Epidemiol. 2006 Jun 15;163(12):1149-56] 

- Related to the treatment and the outcome (confounders)
- Variables only related to the outcome

::: {.notes}
Rubin suggests that including variables that are strongly related to exposure, but unrelated to the outcome, can decrease the efficiency of an estimated exposure effect; but he argues that if such a variable had even a weak effect on the outcome, the bias resulting from its exclusion would dominate any loss of efficiency for a reasonably sized study 
:::

Some variables included were: age, sex, time on treatment, employment, insurance, comorbidities, migrant, education, and others.

## Potential limitations

- The reliability of study results of observational studies will depend on the quality of the data.
- Evaluation of potential biases (selection, information bias, and confounding).
- PS only helps to address measured confounders.
- PS offers to get closer causal effect compared to traditional observational methods

<!--
## Final remarks

- Propensity scores cannot replace randomization but are a good alternative for analyzing non-randomized treatment studies.
and have epistemiological advantages over conventional regression modelling. PS matching, in particular, has a number of advantages. The most important of these is the ability to compare risk factors in the two treatment groups explicitly.

One thing, however, must always be remembered: like conventional regression models, propensity scores can only adjust for patient characteristics that are known and have actually been measured. Only randomized controlled trials can achieve equal distributions of unknown confounding factors too.
